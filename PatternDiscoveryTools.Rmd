Coursera Course Pattern Discovery in Data Mining. I am TAing this course and I want to implement some of the tools in R.


```{r Generate small basket}
set.seed(123)
Itemlist<-c("Beer","Coffee","Nuts","Diapers","Milk","Bread","Wine","Cheese","HotDogs","Steak","Ketchup","Mustard")
library(arules)
N<-6   #Number of transactions
size_transaction<-sample(2:10,N)
DB<-list()
for (i in 1:length(size_transaction))
    {
    newtransactionDB<-sample(Itemlist,size_transaction[i],replace=FALSE)
    DB[i]<-list(newtransactionDB)
}

##This finally works. It generates N transactions from the ItemList without duplicates.

DB<-as(DB,"transactions")  ##Convert to a Matrix that Arules expects.

freqset <-eclat(DB, parameter=list(support=0.5,
                                   minlen =1))
## find frequent itemsets using ECLAT algorithm

inspect(freqset)

rules<-apriori(DB,parameter=list(support=0.5,
                                 confidence =0.5,
                                 minlen =2))

inspect(rules)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r sort rules}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
