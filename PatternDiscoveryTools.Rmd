Coursera Course Pattern Discovery in Data Mining. I am TAing this course and I want to implement some of the tools in R.


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
